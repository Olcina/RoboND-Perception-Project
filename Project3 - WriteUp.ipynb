    "\n",
    "Tweaking a little bit wiht the parameters we can achieve a good performance ~80% in my case. However much more higher performances should be achieved training the model a little bit more. With the initial parameters provided by Udacity the confusion matrix had an overall recognition of 65%. Modifying the number of posses and playing with parameters as the number of bins in the histograms or the kernel in the SVM algorithm we can improve this solutions as shown in the table.\n",

    "The first new step that we need to implement for the object recognition in the 'real environment' is apply a statistical filter. \n",
    "I needed to apply to layers of this filter to get a clean cloud for the objects in the scene. One layer before the vox_grid filter and another after the RANSAC filter, with this two steps I got a clean cloud containing only the objects. \n",

    "Another problems was the elimination of the pieces of the boxes that get into the camera view. The first approach was change the parameter 'min_cluster_size' to 70 and this did the job for the first problem. As this paramater was to high for the small objects as the 'glue' I changed the method applying a new passTrought filter, this time in the axis 'y' within the range (-0.5,0.5).\n",

    "For ease the computation time I changed the number of bins from 64 to 16. I trained all three worlds with a set of 50 poses for each object, using only the RGB spectrum and normal histograms. This settings give me an approximate accuracy of 98%, 93% and 90% for world 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In the next two images we can see the rviz output for the world 2 where the project_template.py script is capable of achieve 4 of 5 objects correctly. The final score for the world 3 was 7 of 8 objects. \n",

    "The main difficulty for computing the yaml dictionaries was understand the data structure of the Ros messages. I spend 30 minutes trying to understand where I was failing after I realized that numpy also have its own type for string variables. changing the assignation of the variable object_name.data from 'object.label' to object_list_param[i]['name']  solved the problem.\n",
